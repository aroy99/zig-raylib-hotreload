# zig-raylib-hotreload
A simple project template for hot reloading code with Raylib

# build instructions
`zig build run` (currently I'm on zig 14 dev) should automatically run the hot-reloaded version of the program.

If you want to reload the code, you need to save and rebuild your source files with `zig build` while the game is running.
